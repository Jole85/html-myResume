    <h1>Summary/Objective Statement</h1>






    <p>Hi, I am a dedicated and detail-oriented professional with extensive experience in the construction industry.
        I also have experience as an educator/personal assistant, as well as in home care and assistance to the elderly
        and in marketing as an advertising material designer. I want to learn Web Development so that I can make
        all my educational materials for children and teenagers with special needs accessible to other
        educators, teachers, parents and of course children. I am currently creating web games that make it easier
        for children to understand and solve text-based math problems, as well as games for learning and writing
        Serbian Cyrillic and Latin, and soon I am planning to unify and publish short games for the elderly,
        with which laughter and a good time are guaranteed!</p>
